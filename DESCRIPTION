Description: Analysis of AMG recordings for the neuromuscular lab. The package
    has four goals: to simplify the process of loading the data into R and
    identifying any issues with the data, finding the peaks of the response,
    performing analysis on the data, and visualizing the AMG data for both
    analysis and presentation.
